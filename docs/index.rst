Welcome to ImmunoGIT documentation!
===================================

ImmunoGIT is a project dedicated to creating a centralized repository of computational models and metadata related to human immune system responses. Positioned at the intersection of computational biology and immunology, ImmunoGIT addresses a need for structured, annotated and shareable resources that enable the proper analysis of complex immune mechanisms, particularly in the context of immune diseases.

The initiative supports the construction of Immune Digital Twins (IDTs)—dynamic virtual representations of the human immune system by giving a proper framework to integrate these to other projects.

ImmunoGIT’s core functionalities :

- Retrieval of SBML and SBML-QUAL models from the BioModels platform using Python scripts and the bioservices library.
- Extraction of associated metadata.

By centralizing and annotating immunological models, ImmunoGIT's aim is to lay the groundwork for a scalable digital infrastructure.
