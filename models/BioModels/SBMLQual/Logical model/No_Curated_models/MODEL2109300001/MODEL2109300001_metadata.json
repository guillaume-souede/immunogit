    "description": "The psoKC (psoriatic keratinocyte) model is represnting the behavour of keratinocytes in the later or chronic stage of psoriasis in response to the main cytokines that constitute the characteristic cytokine milieu, namely IFNg and TNFa (mainly derived by Th1 cells), and IL-17 and IL-22 (mainly derived by Th17 cells).Additionally, the model explores the role of exogenous PGE2 through the activation of EP4 receptor signaling. The response to the aforementioned stimuli was not only limited to the cell fate decisions of keratinocytes (proliferation, apoptosis or differentiation) but also include their effect on the psoriatic environment with respect to the secretion of ligands and intercellular-acting stimuli.",

        "synopsis": "Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease, in which immune cells and keratinocytes keep each other in a state of inflammation. It is believed that phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>)-dependent eicosanoid release plays a key role in this. T-helper (Th) 1-derived cytokines are established activators of phospholipases in keratinocytes, whereas Th17-derived cytokines have largely unknown effects. Logical model simulations describing the function of cytokine and eicosanoid signaling networks combined with experimental data suggest that Th17 cytokines stimulate proinflammatory cytokine expression in psoriatic keratinocytes via activation of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>-EP4 signaling, which could be suppressed using the anti-psoriatic calcipotriol. cPLA<sub>2</sub>α inhibition and calcipotriol distinctly regulate expression of key psoriatic genes, possibly offering therapeutic advantage when applied together. Model simulations additionally suggest EP4 and protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha as drug targets that may restore a normal phenotype. Our work illustrates how the study of complex diseases can benefit from an integrated systems approach.",
