While both experimental and modeling work has been    conducted to understand the molecular genetic mechanisms    involved in CD4+ T cell responses and fate attainment, the    dynamic role of intrinsic (produced by CD4+ T lymphocytes)    versus extrinsic (produced by other cells) components remains    unclear, and the mechanistic and dynamic understanding of the    plastic responses of these cells remains incomplete. In this    work, we studied a regulatory network for the core    transcription factors involved in CD4+ T cell-fate attainment.    We first show that this core is not sufficient to recover    common CD4+ T phenotypes. We thus postulate a minimal Boolean    regulatory network model derived from a larger and more    comprehensive network that is based on experimental data. The    minimal network integrates transcriptional regulation,    signaling pathways and the micro-environment. This network    model recovers reported configurations of most of the    characterized cell types (Th0, Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh, Th9, iTreg,    and Foxp3-independent T regulatory cells). This    transcriptional-signaling regulatory network is robust and    recovers mutant configurations that have been reported    experimentally. Additionally, this model recovers many of the    plasticity patterns documented for different T CD4+ cell types,    as summarized in a cell-fate map. We tested the effects of    various micro-environments and transient perturbations on such    transitions among CD4+ T cell types. Interestingly, most    cell-fate transitions were induced by transient activations,    with the opposite behavior associated with transient    inhibitions. Finally, we used a novel methodology was used to    establish that T-bet, TGF-? and suppressors of cytokine    signaling proteins are keys to recovering observed CD4+ T cell    plastic responses. In conclusion, the observed CD4+ T    cell-types and transition patterns emerge from the feedback    between the intrinsic or intracellular regulatory core and the    micro-environment. We discuss the broader use of this approach    for other plastic systems and possible therapeutic    interventions.</p>  </div></div><div class=\"dc:publisher\">  <p>This model is hosted on   <a href=\"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/\">BioModels Database</a>  and identified by:   <a href=\"http://identifiers.org/biomodels.db/BIOMD0000000593\">BIOMD0000000593</a>.</p>  <p>To cite BioModels Database, please use:   <a href=\"http://identifiers.org/pubmed/25414348\" target=\"_blank\">Chelliah V et al.

The model has 10 nodes but only 5 are shown in the paper.  I assume you wanted to keep the diagram simple in the paper.  Are you happy with this difference?\r<br />\r<br />When I ran the model (in GinSIM) to find the attractors and it shows 9 steady states but the paper (fig 2B) only show 5.  Is this OK?  I assume you only showed the relevant attractors in the paper? The steady states in the paper are all in the above result.\r<br />\r<br />Author reply:\r<br />\r<br />Yes, we only included part of the network and the attractors for simplicity.
