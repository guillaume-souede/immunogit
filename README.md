## Biological Context
The human immune system plays a crucial role in various diseases and health conditions, ranging from defending the body against pathogens to managing autoimmune disorders. Developing a comprehensive, shareable repository of computational models that focus on the human immune system can be pivotal in advancing the concept of **Immune Digital Twins (IDTs)**, which aim to digitally represent the immune system to understand and predict its responses.

## Aim of the Project / Objectives
The main goal of this project is to create a **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) open-access model repository and a metadata catalog that will house published computational models relevant to human immune responses. The repository will feature models from the curated section of the **BioModels** repository, appropriately tagged with metadata related to human immune system responses.

By ensuring proper cataloging, annotation, and curation, these models will serve as building blocks for creating IDTs, facilitating better understanding and simulation of immune system dynamics.

## Bioinformatics Aspects
The students will develop Python scripts (`Python notebooks`) to interact with **bioservices.BioModels**, downloading SBML models from the curated section. These scripts will consider relevant metadata, ontologies, and proper selection of tags and keywords to download SBML (or `SBML.QUAL`) models that are pertinent to human immune system responses.

The curated models and metadata will be hosted in the **GitHub repository** ([https://github.com/ImmuneDT](https://github.com/ImmuneDT)), with appropriate pages and interfaces. Additionally, the students will design and populate the **GitHub website** ([https://immunedt.github.io/](https://immunedt.github.io/)), linking and describing the models and metadata.

This resource will be a significant contribution to the **Working Group Building Immune Digital Twins**, supported by **Research Alliance Europe**. The work will be appropriately cited, and depending on its progress, there is potential for contribution to a peer-reviewed publication.
