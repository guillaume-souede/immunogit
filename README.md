# ImmunoGIT: Building a Model and Metadata Repository Relevant to Human Immune System Responses

## Biological Context
The human immune system plays a crucial role in various diseases and health conditions, ranging from defending the body against pathogens to managing autoimmune disorders. Developing a comprehensive, shareable repository of computational models that focus on the human immune system can be pivotal in advancing the concept of **Immune Digital Twins (IDTs)**, which aim to digitally represent the immune system to understand and predict its responses.
